# üìÉ Bill of Material

## üíµ Total Cost üíµ

```{note}
Doesn't include cost of 3D printing, tools, shippings and taxes.
```

| Price | US | EU | CN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Build from Scratch** | **~$660** | **~‚Ç¨650** | **~¬•3900** |
| **Upgrade from 2 SO100 arms** | **~$400** | **~‚Ç¨440** | **~¬•2400** |
| **Upgrade from 1 Lekiwi** | **~$370** | **~‚Ç¨350** | **~¬•1900** |
| **Upgrade from 1 Lekiwi and 1 SO100 arm** | **~$250** | **~‚Ç¨240** | **~¬•1200** |

```{important}
XLeRobot is designed for maximum power, which is why it only comes in a 12V version. If you're using pre-assembled SO100 and Lekiwi components, it's suggested use their 12V motor versions. While 7.4V motors might function, we don't recommend them since they're untested and won't deliver optimal performance.
```

```{tip}
 While every robot enthusiast should try hands-on assembly at least once, you can purchase [pre-assembled kits](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100#kits) for SO100/SO101 arms at a higher price. The SO100 arms require the most assembly time‚Äîabout 4-6 hours for two arms. Once the arms are complete, the remaining assembly takes just 1-2 hours.
```

### ‚è´ Extra Parts for XLeRobot ‚è´

If you already have two SO100 Arms and one Lekiwi base, you'll need only these additional parts

(please also review the Build From Scratch section below, as the parts list differs slightly)

| Part | Amount | Unit Cost (US) | Buy (US) | Unit Cost (EU) | Buy (EU) | Unit Cost (CN) | Buy (CN) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- Ready-made long 5264 wires are not available for purchase in the US‚Äîonly **connector kits** are available that require manual assembly to extend the length (which is straightforward).
- You can use a similar cart not from IKEA; however, this may require minor adjustments to the [3D printed part](https://www.notion.so/vectorwang/3D_Models/3D_models_for_printing/XLeRobot_special/base_connector.stl).
- While this battery üîã is expensive üíµ, its performance and reliability significantly outperform standard power banks. (Similar to electric vehicles üöó, the battery is one of the costliest components.)
- You can use **other batteries**, but ensure the maximum output capacity can adequately power 2 arms, 3 wheels, and a RaspberryPi (~160W).
- Two Type-C to DC cables (12V) connect the motor control board to the power supply.

### üåø Build From Scratch üåø

For those starting from scratch (without SO100 arms or Lekiwi), you'll need to build the arms and Lekiwi base first, in addition to gathering the parts from *Extra Parts for XLeRobot*.

> 
The parts list for 2√ó SO100 arms and 1 Lekiwi base in this repo includes fewer components than the original bills (primarily cable and battery-related items). If you're building XLeRobot from scratch, you can use this repo's bill directly. However, we recommend checking the other two repos (SO100, Lekiwi) as well for potentially better-priced options.
> 

> 
The new SO101 arm was released (2025.4.28) with improved wiring and easier assembly. This update does not affect the parts list below if you are only making follower arms.

> [!NOTE]
Both SO100 Arms are configured as follower arms in the hardware setup. To save money while building only two arms, you can use one of them as the leader arm for testing teleop‚Äîthere's no need to remove the motor gears.

- You can use any brand of cables (USB-C cable must be fast-charging type), microSD card, and Raspberry Pi 5
- 2 USB-C to USB-A cables to connect the Motor Control Board to Raspberry Pi/PC
- USB-C cable to connect Raspberry Pi to the battery

These components will allow you to replicate Demo 0.1.0, enabling leader-follower arm control and direct PC control of both arms.

### üß© Optional Add-on Features üß©

> 
Today (2025.4.28) the SO101 arm was released with improved wiring and easier assembly, featuring some changes to the leader arms.
> 
- üôåDual-arm leader-follower joint control: Additional two [SO100 arm sets](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main) for dual-arm leader-follower joint control
- ‚úäBetter grip stability: [3M gripper tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093CQPW8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (got it from [UMI gripper specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TPYwV9sNVPAi0ZlAupDMkXZ4CA1hsZx7YDMSmcEy6EU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5k5vwx2iqjqg))
- üëÄVR control: Meta Quest 3 (or 3S)
- For more add-ons and accessories, check out the [SO100 arm repository](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-hardware) and Discord group discussions

### üìã Updated Bill of Materials (BOM)

The BOM is essentially the same as [XLeRobot 0.1.0](https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot/blob/main/BOM.md), with the following additional components:

- [RealSense D415 depth camera](https://a.co/d/hzuPDe6)
- [Anker USB hub](https://a.co/d/6tJW8lN)
- [Hand cameras](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/Optional/Wrist_Cam_Mount_32x32_UVC_Module)
- 2 additional motors (same specifications as arm motors)

With all of these additional sensors and motors, the total cost of XLeRobot 0.2.0 is still less than $1,000, and this hardware setup should enable XLeRobot to autonomously perform many indoor household tasks.
