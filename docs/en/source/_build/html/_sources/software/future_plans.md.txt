# Future Plans

### Hardware

**Urgent**

- 🔧 Add two arm base options: clamp-held (current) or screw-mounted
- 🛠️ Add a connector plate fully compatible with IKEA cart's metal mesh


**In the near future**

- 📸 Add a RealSense depth camera to the head to complement the hand RGB cameras for precise environmental perception
- 🔦 Add a Lidar and SLAM capabilities for Roomba-like home navigation
- 👆 Basic tactile sensing


```{note}
While fancier upgrades are totally possible (like switching to a Jetson processor, upgrading the chassis, or using better motors), these would contradict this project's core mission: creating the world's most affordable, easy-to-install, plug-and-play universal robot opensource platform. But these upgrades can be listed as optional add-ons in the future instead of the main track.

### Software

(software updates will also depend on the development of LeRobot community)


**Urgent**

- ⚙️ Basic control algorithms
- 🎮 Optimized end effector control
- 🎲 Maniskill simulation environment
- 🕶️ Quest3 VR control and teleop
- 🤖 Simple tasks using existing VLA models from Lerobot codebase


**In the near future**

- 🎯 AprilTag-based precise calibration
- 🗺️ Autonomous navigation
- 🌐 Digital twin alignment for sim2real applications
- 🧠 World model and physics-based robust manipulation
- 💬 Connect with MCP to directly utilize LLMs
